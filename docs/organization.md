# Project Organization

The project was managed using GitLab's issue board, with tasks initially assigned to individual team members. However, several challenges arose that impacted the workflow:

- One team member left before the project began, leaving the remaining two to adjust.
- Differences in planning approaches between the remaining members caused delays and misalignment.
- Meetings were infrequent due to conflicting schedules, leading to minimal task assignment and reliance on informal discussions.
- Despite establishing and documenting clear guidelines at the start, they were not consistently followed, further complicating progress.
- Due to significant delays in code reviews, I eventually stopped waiting for reviews to merge my code, prioritizing progress over process.

These issues collectively resulted in delays and ultimately a late delivery of the project.
