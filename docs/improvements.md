# Future Improvements

To further enhance the project and improve its security, efficiency, and maintainability, here are some ideas for improvement:

- **Environment Modes**: Simplify switching between development and production modes to minimize manual configuration. Update the application logic to detect the current environment and load appropriate settings dynamically.
- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Add server-side validation to ensure data integrity.
  - Secure PostgreSQL secrets by moving them out of project files and into a dedicated secret management system.
  - Refine SAST usage by focusing scans and introducing custom rules tailored for Python and JavaScript.
- **Code Quality**: Integrate a linting job into the pipeline to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues early.
- **Optimized Dependency Management**: Ensure test dependencies like Jest and Pytest are installed only during test jobs and not during the build stage to reduce unnecessary overhead.
